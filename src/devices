# /etc/wiimote/devices
# Device name file for wiimote.

# Each line is: BDADDR NAME
# BDADDR must be 17 characters, 6 hexadecimal pairs separated by colons.
# Find your devices' bdaddrs with 'hcitool scan'; they appear as "Nintendo RVL-CNT-01".
# Then you can add a descriptive name here, which can be used to connect the device.

# I cleverly put little stickers on each of my Wiimotes, hence the names:
